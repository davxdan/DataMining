    "Python was founded by a guy named Guido Von Rossum in 1989. I will let him explain his motivations.\n",
    "From wikipedia:\n",
    ">Over six years ago, in December 1989, I was looking for a \"hobby\" programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas. My office ... would be closed, but I had a home computer, and not much else on my hands. I decided to write an interpreter for the new scripting language I had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers. I chose Python as a working title for the project, being in a slightly irreverent mood (and a big fan of Monty Python's Flying Circus).\n",
    "\n",
    "        -Guido van Rossum in 1996\n",
    "\n",
    "So let that be a lesson! Python is not named after the snake, it is after Monty Python. However, even though the language is a bit quirky, do not let that fool you. It is absolutely made for people to use as a serious programming language and tool. Whether you have novice programming skills or are a sesoned veteran at OOP. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, take a look at the most popular programming languages as identified by the number of projects in GitHub, and the number of related questions on stack overflow. Notice the other langauges next to python, like java, php, c++, ruby, and all the heavy hitters. Its also on every top ten list of programming languages needed to get a job in programming. Check it out. Graphic credit given to RedMonk.\n",
    "![Python](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclarson/DataMiningNotebooks/master/data/python_ranking.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, python is one of the fastest growing languages used in scientific computing and data science. According to a recent survey, the three most helpful languages or packages for doing data science are R, SAS, and python. You will likely make use of all three for a given project or set of projects. See http://www.r-bloggers.com/data-science-toolbox-survey-results-surprise-r-and-python-win/ for a high level description of the survey.\n",

    "One easy way to do this is by the using the pdb package. You can run it from the iPython notebook, but it gets quite long on the output trace. You will likely want to copy this test over to another document (for example, debugging.py) and run it from the command line (for example, >python debugging.py). The pdb library allows you to set break points in the files and also step through the program, changing the variable values. \n",
